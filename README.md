<h1>Why did I pick this article?</h1>

<p>I picked this article titled "Software Engineers Will be obsolete by 2060 for a couple of different reasons. Firstly, the title itself really caught my eye. It's not dramatic as "coding is useless - all jobs are projected to be outsourced" nor is it one of those "learn to code and become a millionaire" articles that are really just advertisement for some sort of coding bootcamp. I thought this article would take a reasonable, sensible, middle ground on the question of the future of the job market. </p>

<p>Secondly, this article was interesting because, as its title suggested, it provided sound and realistic advice (or at least convincing) forecasts about what software engineers of the future can expect. Spoiler: The party will last until 2060. </p>>
